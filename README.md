# 🏦 ATM Machine Simulation (Python)

This is a simple Python mini project that simulates the basic working of an ATM machine.
## 🌱 About the Project
The program starts with a **PIN verification system** to allow secure access.
After entering the correct PIN, the user can perform basic ATM operations through a menu-driven interface.

The available options are:
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit the ATM

This project is designed for learning purposes and focuses on clarity and logic rather than real banking complexity.
## 🔐 Features
- PIN authentication before accessing the ATM
- Menu-driven system
- Balance checking
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- Proper handling of invalid choices
## 🧠 What I Learned
By working on this project, I learned:
- How to use `while` loops for repeating menus
- How `if-elif-else` controls program flow
- How to take and validate user input
- How authentication logic works at a basic level
- How to structure a simple Python program
